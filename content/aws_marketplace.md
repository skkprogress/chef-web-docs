Chef Automate is an enterprise platform that allows developers, operations, and security engineers to collaborate on application and infrastructure changes quickly and at scale. Chef Automate provides actionable insights across data centers and cloud providers, wherever your nodes live.

Chef Automate is the center of the modern Chef platform, providing users with a single source of truth for infrastructure, security, and application automation. The comprehensive dashboard offers real-time views of your configuration management activity. Chef Automate comes bundled with the latest Chef Infra Server, providing the core tools you need to manage your enterprise infrastructure. Data collection is enabled by default, allowing your nodes to report activity in real time. This instance is free for 60 days, or you can bring your own license (BYOL).

Use this instance with Chef Workstation installed on your laptop or a separate AWS instance.

## Installation

Select [Chef Automate](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-r26bs6uknftps?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) in the AWS Marketplace.

The Chef Automate AWS deployment uses [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). [Download the CloudFormation template](https://aws-ami-chef-automate-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation_template.yaml) or use the [view the template in CloudFormation Designer](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/designer/home?region=us-east-1&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-fulfillment-cf-templates-prod/658820ac-955d-4f73-bbcd-ab19b598d852.caadc0d6-b62a-4b83-d9b0-ec685d27c0bc.template)

Every CloudFormation Stack deployment creates a new [Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) (VPC).

{{< note >}}
AWS provides 5 VPCs for each region. If you require more VPCs, please contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

### Start Chef Automate with CloudFormation

1. Enter the following values for your deployment.

    ![Enter required information and click next](/images/stack_details.png "Stack Details")

{{< warning >}} The values mentioned above are just an example of what can be the possible values that can be entered. We do not recommend using these values as is. All these values need to be entered based on your infrastructure security principles and should not be taken as actual values. {{< /warning >}}

1. Configure stack options:

    - **Tags:** Create a tag that can be used to refer to your resources (for example, `Key: Name, Value: Chef-automate-stack`).
    - **Permission:** Create an IAM role with `AmazonEC2FullAccess` to enable resource creation using the cloud formation template. Once created, select the IAM role from the dropdown menu.
    - **Stack failure options:** AWS provides two option:

        - **Roll back all stack resources:** In case of failure, it should rollback all created resources (`Default: Roll back all stack resources`).
        - **Preserve successfully provisioned resources:** In case of failure, it will rollback only failed resources.

    ![Enter required information and click next](/images/configure_stack.png "Configure stack")

    - Advanced Options:

        - **Stack Policy:** It is the JSON document that defines the update actions that can be performed on designated resources (`Default: No stack policy`).
        - **Rollback Configuration:** The user can set the alarm to monitor things during stack creation or update. Users must provide a threshold time and area of their cloud watch alarm. This alarm would get triggered if the threshold breaches. Users can enter multiple alarms as well. For more information, refer to [CFN Rollback Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-rollback-triggers.html?icmpid=docs_cfn_console) documentation.

    - **Notification Options:** Create or attach an AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), which would help them get all notifications about their stack creation process on their email.

    ![Enter SNS topic for notifications](/images/notification_options.png "Notification options")

    - **Stack Creation Options:** It has two options:

        1. **Timeout:** If specified and stack creation is not completed in that time, the stack rollback will happen.
        2. **Termination Protection:** You cannot delete the stack directly if enabled. You have to first update it to disabled to delete it.

    Select **Next** and create your Chef Automate deployment. This process can take several minutes.

    Give Chef Automate an additional five minutes for all the services to start running.

## Post-Installation

1. Navigate to the AWS deployment **Outputs** tab and locate the Chef Automate URL, user name, and password. You will need these in the following steps.

## AWS EC2 Access

The AWS EC2 instance connects can be used to access the EC2 machine. Use the AWS EC2 instance for the EC2 device.

1. Select the EC2 machine and then the connect option as shown below:

    ![Add Chef Infra Server Form](/images/select-connect-option-in-ec2machine.png)

1. Select the **Connect** button on the new screen shown below:

    ![Add Chef Infra Server Form](/images/select-button-on-ec2machine.png)

    The above action will launch a new tab for the EC2 connect page, as shown below:

    ![Add Chef Infra Server Form](/images/new-tab-of-ec2-machine.png)

Now the EC2 machine is in a running state where you can run the necessary commands.

## FAQs

### Data Storage in the Machine

The chef automate deployment uses EBS volume, which is attached to an EC2 instance. This EBS volume is created as part of the cloud formation template. This storage is used to store data as part of automate.

Also, on this EC2, we have Postgres and OpenSearch Database running where customers' data is stored. Instead of existing DBs, customers can also configure external databases (Postgres and OpenSearch)based on these configurations [guidelines of Automate](https://docs.chef.io/automate/managed_services/)

### Data encryption configuration

The current setup uses EBS for data storage. The current encryption configuration is enabled for EBS volumes.

### Monitoring

Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring_ec2.html) for the reference of the EC2 monitoring guide.

### Backup

Step-wise instructions for data and Configuration backup for automate can be found [here](https://docs.chef.io/automate/backup/)

The command shown below gives you the data and configuration backup. Use the below command along with the details on the flag option.

```sh
chef-automate backup
```

Click [here](https://docs.chef.io/automate/cli_chef_automate/#chef-automate-backup) to learn more about Chef Automate Backup.

### Secure Access to the Machine

We do not require credential-based access to EC2 machines; hence it is recommended to utilize EC2 Instance Connect functionality. Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) to refer to the guide of EC2 Instance Connect.

### AWS EC2 service limit

Refer to [EC2 service limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ec2-service.html#limits_ec2) link.
